.tyvars:

LEVELS IN TYPE VARIABLES

The typechecking code follows the static semantic rules of the
definition of standard ML almost exactly.  One of the points where it
differs is in its implementation of generalization, when a type is
generalized into a typescheme.

Consider the elaboration (i.e., the typechecking) of a value binding

	val pat = exp

We first compute the type of exp, and this may contain a number of
free type variables.  In the process of elaborating the binding, we
would like to close as many type vars as possible.  However, we can
only close these vars if they do not also occur outside the
expression. e.g., as in

	fun foo x =
	let	
	  val p = x * x
	  ...

where the free type var associated to x in the expression x * x is not
limited to the scope of the expression.  

Thus for every type variable in exp, we have to check the entire
context and ensure that it does not occur there.  This is expensive.

A more efficient test is to stamp type variables with an integer
indicating their scope.  These integers are called levels, and a full
treatment can be found in

	Remy, D. 
	Extension of the ML type system with a sorted equational
	theory on types.
	Rapports de Recherche No. 1766, INRIA

	search in 	http://pauillac.inria.fr/~remy

There, every time a new layer of scoping is entered (e.g., in a let
expression), the level increases by one.  Every typevar which is
exclusively scoped within this new layer will be stamped with this
level.  Therefore, any typevar with a smaller level must also occur
outside this scope.

Therefore, it becomes a simple matter to test whether or not a
variable can be closed at a valbind ocurring at level n: one simply
tests whether or not the tyvar has level m>=n.

Of course, this is not quite what we do in MLWorks!  We do not
associate levels to "depth of scope".  Instead, we associate levels
with "time".  Every typechecker basis/context carries a level
argument: whenever we create a type var from this basis/context, we
stamp *this* number onto the type var.  See

	typechecker/_core_rules.sml: fresh_tyvar

These levels are updated (by the function
typechecker/_basis.sml: new_level_num) by the functions:

	_basis: context_plus_ve
	_basis: context_plus_env
	_basis: basis_plus_env
	_basis: basis_circle_plus_basis
	_basis: basis_plus_basis (unused)

And (as far as I know) nowhere else.  Thus, whenever a basis/context
is updated with a new environment (etc.) the level increases.
Importantly, the level increases monotonically, so we can assert the
important invariant

  for all tyvars tv in environment E of basis/context B/C, 
	                             level_of tv < level_of B/C

(Note that there may be some tyvars in context C which do not have
strictly smaller level: for instance when we use the function
_basis:context_plus_tyvarset (used to add explicitly scoped tyvars in
_core_rules:Absyn.VALdec and _mod_rules:check_valdesc) --- but not
those in an environment, because whenver we add to the environment,
the basis level increases.)

To see what this gives us, consider:

			let dec in exp end
		        C1      C2      C3

The C1,C2,C3 denote the contexts at each point in the evaluation of
the let expression.  At the beginning, we elaborate in context C1.
After elaborating the declarations in dec we add them to C1 to get
context C2.  Now, at this point, every type var occuring solely in dec
will have level equal to (or greater than when we have nested lets
whose elaboration will increase the global level counter) the level of
C1.  Every type var occurring outside the scope of the dec will have
less less than the level of C1. Thus, as in

	typechecker/_scheme.sml: schemify

the test is simply: type var can be closed (generalized) if its level
is greater than or equal to the level of the current context.




.tynames:

LEVELS IN TYNAMES

The revised definition of SML'96 adds a "local datatype check" (see
appendix G.7 of the revised def).  This check is designed to ensure
that expressions of dubious value like

		let datatype t=c in c end
and 

		fn x => let datatype t = c in
			  if true then x else c
		         in 5
		        end

are eliminated by the typechecker.   The point of this change is
to eliminate a soundness problem in the rule for let expressions
in the old definition.  See

	Stefan Kahrs,
	Mistakes and ambiguities in the Definition of Standard ML
	Tech Report. ECS-LFCS-93-257,
	Dept. Comp. Sci., university of Edinburgh, 1993.


To implement local datatype checking, this requires two changes to the
core rules, adding the following checks at rules 4, 14 and 26 of the
revised definition.  These correspond to rules 6, 16 and 27 of the old
definition, which label the code in _core_rules.  Henceforth we shall
refer to the old rule numbers.

Rule 6:
         C\- dec => E     C@@E\- exp => t    tynames t subset T of C
	 ----------------------------------------------------------
		      C\- let dec in exp end => t


tynames t returns the set of "primitive" types that occur in t.
every datatype declaration introduces a new tyname.

We want to check that no typename that occurs in t is scoped within
the let expression.  We can use levels again.  If we stamp new tynames
with the level of the current context, then again, when we come to
update the context (increasing its level) every tyname that occurs
within it will have level *strictly less than* the context level
(either because the tyname was already in the old context, and so had
a smaller level, or because it was new, and was stamped with the level
of the old context, which is less than the level of the new context).

Therefore, in the diagram

			let dec in exp end
			C1      C2      

we have to check that every type name in the type of exp has level
strictly less than that of C1. (Otherwise it would occur in C2 and be
hidden.)  See the code in _core_rules.sml:check_exp(Absyn.LOCALexp...
This uses the function

	_basis.sml: tynamesNotIn

which given a type and a context returns the list of tynames in the
type which do not have level strictly less than that of the context.

The code for the other cases is similarly straightforward (look at the
code for rules 16 and 27 in _core_rules.  These use the function

	_basis.sml:valEnvTynamesNotIn

which works in exactly the same principle: it simply checks that every
tyname in the value environment has the correct level.  (A possible
efficiency increase might be to simply list the levels tynames that
occur in the valenv explicitly, or even just the maximum level.  Then
if that maximum level passed the required test, we could proceed
happily --- otherwise, if it failed, we could search for the escaping
names.)


.tynames.niggle.local:

However, there is a caveat.  The rule for local declarations (rule 21
in revised definition)
			local dec1 in dec2 end

contains no such side-condition, so it is perfectly reasonable for
dec2 to return hidden typenames.  This causes problems, for example
in


C1   let
       local datatype t1 = c in datatype t2 = b of t1 end;
C2     fun f var = b var
C3    in
     end

The type name t1 is hidden in the environment returned from the
elaboration of the local dec, i.e., it exists hidden in C2, i.e., it
has a smaller level than that of C2.  This means that f will
elaborate, even though it's type consists of a hidden type var.  As
far as I can make out, the revised definition permits this.

(It wouldn't be hard to either a) forbid escaping type names in the
local declaration, or b) forbid their use in subsequent defs.)


.tynames.niggle.separate-compilation:

Another place where scoping is controlled is in our separate
compilation mechanism.  The problem here is that even though a module
has been compiled, it may only be in the scope of a different module
if it explicitly "required".  Of course, when compiling a subsequent
module, the context level will be greater than the tynames which are
not meant to be in scope, and so they will appear to be in scope.

For example, consider the three files foo.sml, bar.sml and baz.sml:

	foo.sml:   datatype fruit = apple | banana;

	bar.sml:   require "foo";
		   fun f () = apple;

	baz.sml:   require "bar";
		   fun g x = f();

After evaluating the expression we get 

	val g: 'a -> fruit(hidden) = fn

at the top-level, even though the tyname fruit is not in scope.

We don't address this issue because this "problem" is also a feature
of the old system before updating, and the change is only for let
expressions and function bindings in the core.




.tynames.check.timings:

HOW EXPENSIVE THE CHECK

Here we compare the time it takes for the ordinary compiler (without
local datatype checking) to compile the local datatype-checking code,
with the augmented compiler.

The time taken measures how long it takes to rebuild everything from
scratch (I simply remove the pervasive mos and leave the compiler to
do the rest.)

.tynames.files.altered:

FILES CHANGED

If for any reason one wants to alter the tyname levels implementation
the following is a list of files you have to change:

	typechecker/datatypes.sml
	typechecker/_datatypes.sml   actual TYNAME constructor defn
	typechecker/basis.sml
	typechecker/_basis.sml	     tynameLevelsOK functions
	typechecker/types.sml        make_tyname
	typechecker/_types.sml	     initial tynames plus make_tyname
	typechecker/_core_rules.sml
	typechecker/_mod_rules.sml
	typechecker/nameset.sml
	typechecker/sigma.sml

	interpreter/_shell_structure.sml  instance of Types.make_tyname
	interpreter/_inspector_values.sml instance of TYNAME
	main/_encapsulate.sml		  instances of TYNAME

The following merely propagate the information around:

	typechecker/_sigma.sml
	typechecker/_nameset.sml
	typechecker/[_]environment.sml
	typechecker/[_]completion.sml

	debugger/_debugger_print.sml
	debugger/_debugger_utilities.sml
	debugger/_value_printer.sml

	interpreter/_entry.sml
	
	lambda/_lambda.sml

A number of other files also pass TYNAMES around, but because they use the
trick
	TYNAME ({1=...,5=...})

to decompose the tuple, they don't mention the extra sixth argument, and
so don't have to be altered.@
