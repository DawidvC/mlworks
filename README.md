MLWorks Temporary Repository
============================
MLWorks is a compiler and interactive development environment for the
Standard ML language, developed by Harlequin in the 1990s and now owned by
Ravenbrook Limited.

**IMPORTANT**: This is a temporary Git repository starting at the latest
revision of the MLWorks sources, and does not include the full version
history. This repository will be *replaced* by one with a full history,
and any work will need to be migrated.  Please consider this before cloning
or forking.

MLWorks is a commercially developed "industrial strength" ML development
system, developed by Harlequin in the 1990s.  Harlequin broke up in
1998, and MLWorks became property of Xanalys Limited.  Ravenbrook
Limited (whose directors were members of the original MLWorks team)
acquired the rights to MLWorks on 2013-04-26 and open sourced the
project.

Ravenbrook would like to thank Xanalys, and especially Paul Miller, for
being both willing and generous to help with the open source publishing
of this work.
