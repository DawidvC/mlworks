		Problem description and background

Please complete all relevant questions.

1. Please describe the problem, question, comment or suggestion:

2. Please give full details of the hardware platform, model, operating
system, memory and swap space:

   SunOS:   "showrev -a", "uname -a", "dmesg|grep mem", 
	    "dmesg|grep cpu", "pstat -s"
   Solaris: "showrev -a", "uname -a", "prtconf", "swap -s"
   SGI:     "uname -a", "hinv", "swap -s"
   Windows NT4.0:  from the Start menu, select Run... and type 
		   "winmsd"
   Windows NT3.51: from the File/Program Manager, select File... 
		   Run... and type "winmsd"
   Windows95:      from the Start menu, select Settings... Control 
		   Panel... and double click on the System icon

3. If you are using a Unix system, please supply:

   a) The version and supplier of the X Windows System (e.g. X11R5 or
X11R6, MIT or SGI or Sun).
   
   b) The Window Manager.

   c) If you using SunOS or Solaris, which MLWorks runtime you are 
using: main or main-static.  If you are using main, please give the 
versions of the X, Xt and Xm libraries (e.g. the output of the ldd 
command).
   
   d) If you are running MLWorks on a different machine from the X 
server, please give the details listed under (2) for both machines.

   e) The results of running xhost and printenv DISPLAY.

4. Please supply a small testcase so that we can recreate the problem
 - if possible, less than 50 lines of code.  We understand how 
difficult this can be, but in many instances a testcase is the only 
manner in which we can reliably recreate, diagnose, and resolve 
customers' problems.

NOTE: We would request that a testcase be able to be run standalone: 
the reported behavior should be reproducible in a fresh or base 
MLWorks image without application code and on a standard hardware 
platform.   

Also NOTE: If the testcase is an entire application it may not be as
critical as some of the other info, especially the complete backtrace
(see below).  

5) Please supply a complete transcript of the session in question, to
include:

   a) The command, menu item or icon used to invoke MLWorks.

   b) In addition to the testcase code, please include all of the 
commands used by you to build, load, and run your testcase and that 
recreate the problem being reported.  This includes any error messages
and/or stack backtraces, and any other output.

NOTE: By default an uncaught exception pops up the Stack Browser tool.
If you switch this off in the Preferences>General dialog, the 
backtrace is printed in the listener instead.  You can copy and paste
it from there.

6) Is there anything else you think might be useful for us to know?  
This may include the following:  

   a) Are there any other errors occurring (or is the error always the
same)?

   b) What is being done when the error occurred?

   c) Is the problem easily reproducible or does the error just happen
the application has been running for some time?

   d) On Unix, is the problem reproducible when you run mlworks with 
the "-tty" argument, using the appropriate Shell.* functions?

   e) Is there another similar machine available (the same platform 
or a different model or one running a slightly different version of 
the operating system)?  Does the same behavior/problem also occur 
there?  What about a release of MLWorks on a different platform (if 
available)?  Does this same behavior/problem occur there as well?   

7) What impact is this problem having on your work with MLWorks?  
   (eg. Critical, Serious, Moderate, Low, FYI/Request)


Thank you very much for your continued interest in Harlequin MLWorks
products as well as for your patience, understanding, and input!!
