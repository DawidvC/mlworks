Revision 1.2  1992/03/10  12:23:09  matthew
Added an error reporting function

Revision 1.1  1991/09/06  16:49:28  nickh
Initial revision

Copyright (c) 1991 Harlequin Ltd.

Don't want to interrupt lexing with raising exceptions (unless there is a restart mechanism
installed, so we will have a funcion to call that can do something less drastic.  Functions
that call this still have the responsibility of recovering from the error themselves.
*)

THIS FILE IS NO LONGER USED

signature LEXBASICS =
  sig
    exception LexError of string;
    val report_lex_error : string -> unit
