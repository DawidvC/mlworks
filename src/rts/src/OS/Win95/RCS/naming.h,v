@/*  ==== Linker naming macros ====
 *
 *  Copyright (C) 1994 Harlequin Ltd
 *
 *  Description
 *  -----------
 *
 * This header defines a macro which produces a label for a C object,
 * as produced by the C compiler (and expected by the linker) on this
 * OS. It is used in the asm interface, as shown in these two examples:
 * 
 * 	.global C_NAME(ml_gc)
 * 
 * 	call C_NAME(gc)
