# README for SHA implementation, as adapted for MLWorks.
#

This directory contains a public-domain implementation of the NIST Secure
Hash Algorithm.  MLWorks uses this for its registration scheme.   The
directory contains the following files:

sha.h, sha.c:	The algorithm.  DaveB added sha_string and sha_sprint for
MLWorks.  Otherwise these files are unaltered.

sha_driver.c, appgen.c, sha.good.outputs: Test files for sha.c.  These are
unaltered.

mlw_mklic.c, mlw_mklic.h : A tool for generating code strings from
license names.  This gives the code strings that we give to users so
that they can start MLWorks.  (Written by DaveB & other MLWorkers.)

Makefile: mlw_mklic target added by MLWorkers.  Otherwise unaltered.
