 *  Description
 *  -----------
 *  This is an out of date definition of OS.Path.  It has been replaced
 *  by os_path.sml.  This version is still here because it is still used
 *  internally by the compiler.  Don't use this version, and if you have
 *  any time spare, replace all references to it by the appropriate type/value
 *  in os_path and then remove this!
 *
 *
 *  isValidRoot has the type string -> bool here, not path_root -> bool.
