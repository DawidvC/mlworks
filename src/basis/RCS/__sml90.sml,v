        be manipulated by the functions provided in BasVal.'' *)
  (* Only two uses of the Io exception are mentioned by the defn, these
     are included here.  Any other exceptions encountered also cause Io to be
     raised but just with the function name as additional data --- this
     prevents the user from being aware of the underlying TextIO calls
     and encountering new basis exceptions. *)
