.TH MLIMAGE 1 1996-08-15 Harlequin MLWORKS
.SH NAME
mlimage \- Restarts an MLWorks session saved in an image file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mlimage
[
.B -mono 
]
.B -load 
.I image-file 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B mlimage
restarts an
.B MLWorks
session saved in an image file (a 
.B \.img
file) with the File > Save Image menu item on
the
.B MLWorks
console, or with the interactive context function 
.B Shell.saveImage.
For running other image files, use 
.B mlrun\fR(1).
.LP
.B mlimage
starts MLWorks as though you have called
.B mlworks\fR(1)
and reinstates the top-level interactive context as it stood at
the time the image file was saved.  All items evaluated and loaded
into MLWorks at that time will be available in the restarted image.
Preference settings, trace manager, and breakpoint manager settings
are also reinstated. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.B -load \fIfilename
Restart the session image in 
.I filename
.TP 6
.B -mono 
Disables the use of colours in X, and should  be given when 
.B MLWorks
is used on a monochrome screen. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
This section lists the fatal errors that may occur and their causes.
.LP
.PD 0
The file `\fIname\fR' is not in the correct image format.
.LP
The image file `\fIname\fR' is incompatible with the current version of the image loader.
.LP
The image loader was unable to allocate enough memory while loading the file `\fIname\fR'.
.LP
The image loader was unable to open the file `\fIname\fR'.
.LP
The loader was unable to read from the file `\fIname\fR' despite being able to open it.
.PD
.RS 4
These errors occur in conjunction with the
.B -load
option.
.RE
.LP
.PD 0
An unknown option `\fIarg\fR' was specified.  Use `-help' for help.
.LP
The wrong number of arguments were specified for the option
`\fIoption\fR'.  Use -help for help.
.LP
Missing closing delimiter after option `\fIoption\fR'.  Use `-help' for help.
.PD
.RS 4
These errors occur when the form of the call to
.B mlimage
is incorrect.
.RE
.LP
The file `\fIname\fR' is not in the correct image format.
.RS 4
Check that the file specified is really an image file output
from MLWorks.  If it is then either it has been corrupted or
there is a problem with the compiler.
.RE
.LP
The global state in the image file `\fIname\fR' does not correspond to
that of this runtime system.
.RS 4
This error indicates that the runtime system is not compatible with
the image.  It should only occur when an image from one release is
used with a runtime system from another, incompatible, release.
.RE
.LP
.PD 0
The image loader was unable to open the file `\fIname\fR'.
.LP
The image loader was unable to read from the file `\fIname\fR' despite being able to open it.
.PD
.RS 4
Check that the specified files exist and are not protected against reading.
