The parser is generated from the MLWorks versions of sml-yacc and sml-lex
(by Appel, Tarditi and Mattson).

You must have executables of both sml-yacc and sml-lex (see their
documentation for how to produce these).

Create the source files using the commands
  sml-yacc -pass a fi.grm a
and
  sml-lex -pass a fi.lex a

This produces the files fi_grm.sml, _fi_grm.sml and fi_lex.sml.

Compile the file __fi_parser (which contains the structure FIParser) using
either the GUI (with the Basis loaded) or the batch compiler.  Some
sml-yacc files are required when compiling, you must add the sml-yacc source
directory to the path so that the compiler can find them.

The signatures required by code using the parser are FI_ABS_SYNTAX and
FI_PARSER (in fi_abs_syntax and fi_parser).
The structure FIParser (in fi_parser) corresponds to the FI_PARSER
signature and will be required by code using the parser.
