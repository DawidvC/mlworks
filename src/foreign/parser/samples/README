This directory contains sample files for the Foreign Interface parser.

To use them:

  Use the GUI with the Basis loaded.

  Compile the parser structure (FIParser, in src/foreign/parser/__fi_parser).

  At the listener type:
    print (FIParser.FIAbsSyntax.stringDeclList
             (FIParser.parseFile <FILENAME>));
  (where <FILENAME> is the full pathname of the sample).

  The printed output is generated from the abstract syntax, it should
  closely resemble the input file.
