README for foreign/samples  (Unix platforms)
============================================

CONTENTS:

  1.    Introduction
  2.    The examples
  2.1.  hello example
  2.2.  random example
  3.    The LD_LIBRARY_PATH



1. Introduction
===============

Two examples are given illustrating how the MLWorks(TM) FI operates.
As examples, they do not do a great deal in their own right.  However,
we hope that they illustrate the basic concept and suggest the kind of
thing that is needed to put your own interfaces together via the FI.

There are many coding styles possible within ML and these samples
merely give particular examples - we neither recommend nor condemn
them.  In particular, the code given here is advisory and given purely
to assist you with making use of the MLWorks FI.


2. The examples
===============

The examples should be run from a source directory containing the
samples in a subdirectory called `foreign/samples'.  This requirement
can be changed by editing the appropriate filenames used by calls of
`loadObjectFile' in the ML files.

Before the examples can be executed from MLWorks, the corresponding C
code has to be compiled.  To do this, type:

   gnumake all

in the foreign/samples directory.  This will generate the code for
your platform.  When you wish to remove the object files (including
shared object code), type:

   gnumake clean

We now briefly describe the examples.  These can either be compiled
and loaded by using the Project Workspace tool in the MLWorks GUI
and opening the foreign_samples.mlp project file, or
programmatically as shown below.  The examples assume that
MLWorks is being run from the installation directory.

    2.1 Hello example
    =================

    Load by:

        Shell.Project.openProject "foreign/samples/foreign_samples.mlp";
        Shell.Project.setTargets ["hello.sml"];
        Shell.Project.compileAll ();
        Shell.Project.loadAll ();

    Description:
        A very simple example which calls a simple foreign function
        with an integer argument.  It prints a message to standard
        output - this will usually be the controlling tty.

        Note that when this example is loaded, the message
        printed by the foreign function appears *before* all the ML binding
        information is printed.  This is because the foreign function is
        called *during* the load - and the bindings are always printed at the
        end of the load.


    2.2 Random example
    ==================

    Load by:

        Shell.Project.openProject "foreign/samples/foreign_samples.mlp"; 
        Shell.Project.setTargets ["random.sml", "__random.sml"];
        Shell.Project.compileAll ();
        Shell.Project.loadAll ();

    Description:
        This example uses a foreign C function to provide a random number
        generation facility (see the signature file random.sml).



3. The LD_LIBRARY_PATH
======================

The MLWorks FI exploits dynamic linking of object files as supported by
your host operating system.  On UNIX based systems, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable is used to provide a way of locating system-wide
shared libraries and such like.

Because the FI relies upon dynamic linking, it _may_ be necessary to
modify your setting of this variable to use the MLWorks FI.

The procedure we recommend you follow is as follows (we use Bourne shell
syntax):

   0)  Try to run the the examples without changing anything.
       If the examples run without failing, then all is well.


   1)  If the examples fail with some message like:

            Stub interception failed
            Shared object does not exist

       or similar, then suspect the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting.

       Try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the current directory:

            DEFAULT_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


       and rerun the examples.

       Note that the above `saves' your value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       within the environment variable DEFAULT_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
       This will be used by the next step, should that become
       necessary.


   2)  If step (1) fails, then try using the following host OS specific
       steps:


       2a)  Restore default value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DEFAULT_LD_LIBRARY_PATH


       2b)  Depending upon your OS version (use `uname -a' to determine
            this), try the following:

            SunOS 5.* (Solaris) :

                LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:/usr:/usr/ucblib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/lib"


            IRIX 5.* :
            
                LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/lib"


	    Linux 2.* (e.g., Red Hat 4.*, 5.0):

                LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/lib"



       2c)  Finally, remember to export the new value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
            
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


   3)  If all of the above fails then we suggest contacting your local system
       administration support team for assistance.  As this would appear to be
       a local problem, it is very likely that your local system administration
       support team has already solved this for other users and products.

       Also, please contact MLWorks support at Harlequin - we will do
       all we can to assist you further.
