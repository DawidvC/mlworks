@Module to perform forward dataflow optimisations (available expression
substitution and copy propagation). Created from version 1.8 of
_mirdataflow.sml.
This is the structure.

Revision 1.6  1992/02/11  13:17:09  richard
Changed the application of the Diagnostic functor to take the Text
structure as a parameter.  See utils/diagnostic.sml for details.

Revision 1.5  1992/01/03  16:00:59  richard
Added Option module to dependencies.

Revision 1.4  1991/11/19  12:32:00  richard
Changed debugging output to use the Diagnostic module, which
prevents the debugging output strings being constructed even
if they aren't printed.

Revision 1.3  91/10/17  11:51:07  richard
Added Switches structure.

Revision 1.2  91/09/18  16:09:24  richard
Removed code which explicitly followed the flow of control and
replaced with invocations of the MirFlow module, which is new.
