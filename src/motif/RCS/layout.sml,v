  (* The lay_out function sets up the constraint resources for the children
     of a form such that they are laid out from top to bottom, in the order
     they appear in the list.  The first text widget in the list, if any,
     will resize to match any changes in the size of the form.
     
     All widgets will have space to the left and right, except for menu bars.
