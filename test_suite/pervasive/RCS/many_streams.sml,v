(*

This is concerned with bug 821, which hung MLWorks in the garbage
collector if collecting generations 0 and 1 when there are no arrays
pointing gen 1 -> gen 0 but there is at least one weakarray pointing
into gen 0, the contents of which have died since the last GC.

This code will trigger the bug, if present (it's now
fixed). Unfortunately the symptom is not an error message or even a
core dump but an infinite loop in the GC.

Nick B, 1994-11-25

*)

(* All streams are kept in a weak array; we need to make and forget a
 * stream (so that the weak array entry becomes 'DEAD'). We use a
 * filename which we should usually be able to read *)

fun discard_stream () = TextIO.closeIn(TextIO.openIn "perl_script");

(* The bug only shows up when collecting generations 0 and 1, so we
need to do a lot of allocation to trigger it. This function allocates
800k of heap and returns a pointer to it. *)

fun makelist () = let fun mkl (0,a) = a
		        | mkl (n,a) = mkl (n-1,n::a)
		  in mkl (100000,[])
		  end

(* Because we want a generation 1 collection fairly soon, we need to
remember most of the allocated data (otherwise nothing gets into gen 1
out of gen 0 and gen 1 fills up very slowly). So this function calls
both the above functions and accumulates the allocated heap. *)

fun body l = (discard_stream ();
	      (makelist ())::l);

(* Now we put that function in a loop, so it can be called many times *)

fun loop n f a = let fun loop' (0,acc) = ()
		       | loop' (n,acc) = loop'(n-1,f acc)
		 in loop'(n,a)
		 end

(* This call should cause the bug if present (it should take about
11-12 seconds on abel, if the bug does not bite). *)

val _ = loop 30 body [];
