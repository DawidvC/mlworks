Setting current mode has a bearing on where object files go.

Changing mode should force compiler to look elsewhere for object files.

@Request #30362:  Setting mode has no effect.

You can now set modes from within the Project Workspace to be applied
to the project.  Within the Project Properties dialog for modes
(select Project->Properties->Modes from the menu) you can now define
your own mode by adding the new mode and setting the options for it,
or you can choose an existing mode and make it current.  Note that the
list of modes is only a list of available modes and the only mode
which has any effect is the current mode.  The current mode also
affects where object files go, and changing the current mode should
update the object file location displayed in the Project Workspace.
Object files are now placed in the following hierarchy:

<basic_object_location>/<configuration>/<mode>

so that for a configuration set to I386/NT and mode set to Release, 
the object files go to:

objects/I386/NT/Release/

Within the project file there should be a setting to specify the
current mode which should always be Release.  


---------------

Request #30385: Changing mode should force compiler to look elsewhere 
for object files.

Changing the mode in the Project Workspace should result in the object
file information displayed in the Project Workspace to be updated when 
the dependencies are read.  This also means issuing a compile command
after changing the mode should compile the object files to the new
objects directory (changing the mode changes where the objects go/are
found).@
