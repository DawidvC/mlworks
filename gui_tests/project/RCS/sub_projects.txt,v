@Request #30365: Implement subprojects in Project Workspace.

Projects can now be hierarchical.  Things to test:

1)	There should be no circular references between projects.  
For instance, a project A cannot be a sub-project of project B if
project B is a sub-project of A.  Entering sub-projects via the 
project properties in the GUI should check for this and not allow
it.

2)	A project cannot have two sub-projects which are the same
file.  Again project properties should check for this.

3)	If project A has a current configuration of CC and project
B is a sub-project of A then the configuration CC is used when 
checking dependencies and compiling sub-project B regardless of 
what the current configuration of B is.

4)	If project A has current mode set to Debug and sub-project 
B has current mode set to Release, Project B will be compiled in
Release mode and project A will be compiled in Debug mode.

5)	When compiling project A which has project B as a sub-project,
the units displayed in the Project Workspace should only include 
those which are required by project A and not required by project B,
even although files from the sub-project may still be compiled if 
need be.

6)	Using the original project file, mlworks.mlp, which does not
include any sub-projects, should still work.
