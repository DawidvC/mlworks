@Request #30369:  Replace source path with a list of files.

Make sure that all the project files work to the extent of 
finding all the source files correctly.  This can be tested
by setting an incorrect objects location, and then reading
dependencies.  Also check that files can be entered using 
a multiple selection dialog box - see Project > Properties >
Files and check the behaviour of that dialog.  It should 
allow you to enter all the files from a given directory and
it should also allow you to specifically select a number of 
files, by holding down the shift and control keys in the 
file selection dialog box.
