@Request #30182: Pressing 'home' key causes problems on Win32

In the Listener, after the prompt, press shift+home to select the
prompt, and then press the 'delete' key (not the backspace key).  This
action should not be allowed and you should hear a beep to indicate
that no deletions before the end of the prompt are allowed.  Also,
after the prompt pressing the 'delete' key should result in the
character after the cursor to be deleted if there is no selection
otherwise the selection will be deleted.@
