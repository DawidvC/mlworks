@Request #50035:  Keyboard accelerators.

The keys used to navigate within the Listener are now platform
specific.  On Windows the Ctrl- keys are not used (except for
cutting, copying and pasting text), and the cursor keys + HOME
+ END keys should now be used to move the cursor.  On Motif,
nothing has changed so that keys such as Ctrl-E should move to
the end of the current line.  Also F4 as well as Ctrl-F4 closes
the current window on the Windows platforms.@
