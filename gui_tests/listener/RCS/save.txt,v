@Request #50019: Saving source on 95/NT

Type some declarations into a new Listener, save the source to a file
(saved_source.sml), then read the file back into the Listener by 
selecting File->ReadIntoListener.  Then choose
File->SaveListenerInput, and inspect the contents of the saved file
saved_source.sml and it will show only one occurence of the Use
command.  After that type two definitions without separating them by a
semicolon, and then select File->SaveListenerInput, and inspect the
file again to see that only one occurrence of the definitions are
saved.@
