@Request #30257:  Problems with life demo on Win95

Generations were not correct as they were interacting with each other
because the timer was allowing them to go too fast.  This can be seen
by irregular, and different behaviour occuring between different runs
of the demo.  This is now fixed, and this symptom should not be
noticable.
