@[Bug #30130]
Test for quit while continuously running.
@
text
@Bug number 2039.

Run life.sml on Windows 95 or NT 3.51 (it seems to be OK on NT 4.0).
Type 'x' in the life window to quit.  This should close the window and
return to MLWorks.  The erroneous behaviour was to crash MLWorks.


Bug number 30130.

Run life.sml on Windows.  Start running continuously.  Type another key
a couple of times.  Stop running continuously.  Type another key a couple
of times.   Start running continuously again a type another key a few
more times.   Then type 'x' (while still running continuously).  The
demo should exit properly.  The erroneous behaviour was to exit, leaving
the listener in the "evaluating" state.  The only possible action was
to kill MLWorks from the task manager.
