@[Bug #30020]
Added test for delivered example not requiring app-defaults file.
@
text
@Request 20010.

Run a delivered life.exe.  Press 's' to start continuous update.  Press
some other key (e.g. 'n') and hold it down so that several key press
events are generated.  Then press 's' again.  The continuous update should
stop.  Before this change, it would often ignore any further keyboard
input.



Request 30020.

Run a delivered life.exe with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH unset.  It should work
fine.  Before this change, it would complain that it couldn't find the
MLWorks resources.
