Request #30344: Check that windows retain size and position when
closed and re-opened.

This change only applies to Windows platforms at the moment.

All MLWorks windows should remember their previous size and position
after they have been closed and re-opened.  The windows that should
have this behaviour include: 

all the windows within the Tools menu,
all the dialogs of Project Properties,
the profile tool,
the stack browser,
the error browser,
the file viewer,
the inspector tool,
and the systems messages window.@
