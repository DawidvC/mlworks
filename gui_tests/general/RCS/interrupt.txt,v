@Request #30179:  Fixing interrupt button on Unix.

Previously the interrupt button did not work on Unix due to it not
being registered properly.  The simple test for this is that the
interrupt button should now work so that long compilations and
infinite loops can be interrupted.  After clicking the interrupt
button it may take a couple of seconds or so to register the click
during intensive execution.@
