@[Bug #30212]
test file for allowing user to type license after one has expired.
@
text
@Change 2705.

On any Unix platform, remove .mlworks_user, unset MLWORKS_LICENSE and run
mlworks.  It should prompt for registration licensing.


Change 2708.

Ensure that the license dialog pops up correctly on Unix when using
license registration.  To test, remove .mlworks_user, unset MLWORKS_LICENSE
and run mlworks.


Change 30176.

On Windows, check that the encoded license is stored in the registry under
the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Harlequin\MLWorks.  The key should not
include the MLWorks version number.


Change 20074:  Improve license dialog.

Windows: cut, copy and paste accelerator keys now work:  Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, and
Ctrl-V respectively to and from each input text box on the dialog.  
Windows and Unix:  User is given the option to retry to input the license
information - there is now a 'Retry' button on the complain box.  When the 
license dialog pops up again, the text fields contain what the user last 
typed in.


Change 30212:  MLWorks should prompt for new license when stored license expires

On all platforms, if a stored license is either invalid or has expired, the user
is given the chance to type in a new license, and if even the new typed license
is invalid, the user is given a further chance and so on.  This applies to
the tty interface as well as the GUI.@
