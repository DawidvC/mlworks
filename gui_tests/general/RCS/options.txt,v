@[Bug #30280]
Added test for compiling for R3000.
@
text
@Request #30280:  Don't compile for R3000 by default.

When running on a MIPS, check the value of the "Compile for MIPS R4000 and
later" compiler option.  It should be on by default.



Request #20033:  Adding -no-banner and changing -quiet to -silent and 
suppressing prompt.

Pass the -no-banner option when running either the batch image or the gui 
image (whether in tty mode or not) and no MLWorks banner should be displayed.

Pass the -silent option to the gui image in tty mode only, and no prompt will 
be displayed.  The prompt should still be displayed in gui (non-tty) mode 
whether or not -silent was specified.
