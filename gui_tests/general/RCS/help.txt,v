@[Bug #30125]
Test for help doc links to web on Unix.

@Request #30124:  Win32: Add a link from GUI to help docs on the web.

The help menu now has extra items which link to help documentation
found on the web.  Selecting one of these help items should bring
up a web browser and open the appropriate URL location.  These help
menu items should be available at all times.  If the default web 
browser is either Netscape or Internet Explorer then it is 
guaranteed to bring up the web browser if it is already running 
or automatically start a new web browser if required.


-------------------------

Request #30125:  Unix: Add a link from GUI to help docs on the web.

There is a new help menu on Unix which consists of links to the help
documentation stored as html files.  Netscape and Mosaic are the only
web browsers supported and if another is specified and the user tries
to get help then a message box displays a message indicating that only
Netscape and Mosaic are supported.  As in the Win32 behaviour,
selecting a help menu command should bring up a web browser (specified
by setting the MLWORKS_WEB_BROWSER environment variable) and open the
appropriate URL location.  MLWORKS_DOC environment variable also needs
to be set to the location of the documentation.  Note that for
environment variables to take effect, MLWorks needs to be restarted.
