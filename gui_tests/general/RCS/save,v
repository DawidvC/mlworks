@[Bug #30283]
Added test that listener input is cleared in a saved image.
@
text
@Request 30283:

Load guib.img (e.g. by running mlworks-basis).  Before doing anything
else, check that the "Save Listener Input As..." entry on the File menu
is disabled.  Evaluate something in the Listener.   Check that the
menu entry is now enabled.  Save the listener input in a file.
Check that the file contains no extra commands, and can be loaded
by "Read Into Listener".



-------

Need to check that we can save images to files which don't yet exist.

From the podium menu, select File>Save session as
and choose a file not in the list. Provided the file can be opened for
writing you should still be able to save to it. Similarly, try giving
a path name, ie including a directory which exists, and then each of a
file which exists, and a file which doesn't exist. Again, you should
succeed whenever the file can be opened for writing. Finally, try
giving a name of a file which cannot be opened for writing, eg because
of a bad path or name and check that you fail and are told so.
