***************** COMPUTATIONAL CATEGORY THEORY *******************

This is a directory of categorical programs written in Standard ML.

   FILES:

The files "basic" and "cat" should be compiled first and then others
according to the dependencies stated in the files.

   EXAMPLES:

Files "x.blah" contain examples of `blah' and may be run when "blah"
has been compiled.

   COMPILATION:

To compile a file `name', enter Standard ML and type:

      use "name";

This will compile value and function definitions and evaluate
expressions.
