		chosen.

		guess example.

Guess example
-------------

This example demostrates the use of a simple CAPI interface 
to the low-level graphics commands and also demostrates how 
a project can be built up.  The CAPI signature can be platform
independent with different implementations of CAPI (__capi.sml)
for each platform and this enables applications (in this case 
simple ones) to be portable across different platforms.

To load the guess example, start MLWorks and open the guess.mlp
project file, then select Project->CompileTargetSources followed
by Project->LoadTargets.  In the Listener type 'guess();' and the
guess demo should start by displaying the guess window.  In 
this simple demo you have to guess the number (1-1000) that the
computer has thought of and the number of guesses you make is 
recorded and also each time you make a guess a clue is given
as to whether the correct number is greater than or less than 
your guess.  

Note for Motif users: If you want to display the demo while 
running the MLWorks gui, use the display_guess() function to 
run the demo.
