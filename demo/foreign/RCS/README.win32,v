@[Bug #190548]
Fix typos and pathnames.
@
text
@Each example involves creating a .DLL specific to that example.  In
order to create the .DLL, the value of MLWORKS_INCLUDE must be set to
point to the directory that contains MLW_CI.H and MLWORKS_LIB must be
set to point to LIBMLW.LIB.  The Makefile in each example is set to
point at the default locations of these values, so all you should need
to do to build the .DLL for each example is type

  > nmake

in each example.  If the make works correctly it should result in a
.DLL being produced.  For example, if the above is run in the add
example directory, then it should produce ADD_STUB.DLL.


If for some reason mlw_ci.h and libmlw.lib are not in their default
locations, then you can alter the value of MLWORKS_INCLUDE and
MLWORKS_LIB in a number of ways: the values can be set on the command
line or they can be edited into the Makefile for each example.

For example, assuming that MLWorks is installed in C:\MLWorks, you
could either edit each Makefile to include :-

  MLWORKS_INCLUDE=C:\MLWorks\foreign
  MLWORKS_LIB=C:\MLWorks\bin\libmlw.lib

and then just type

  > nmake

as before, or pass the values to nmake :-

  > nmake MLWORKS_INCLUDE=C:\MLWorks\foreign MLWORKS_LIB=C:\MLWorks\bin\libmlw.lib
